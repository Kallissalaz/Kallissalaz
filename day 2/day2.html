<h2> These cartoons is the top four scariest cartoon to ever exist to kme when I was younger. Casper may have been called "the friendly ghost" but I was scared of him. Coraline however I would say when I was younger I was scared of my dolls because I thought they were living the coraline life. The monster house i would be scared of my neighbors even though it may sounds funny but I was. Scooby-Doo was one of my fanorites house of all time. I enjoy every episode of them saving the city. </h2>
